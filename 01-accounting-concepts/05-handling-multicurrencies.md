## Part 5: Managing Multi-Currencies

### Strategies for Handling Multiple Currencies
- **Options**:
  - Businesses may opt to maintain separate A/P, A/R, and bank accounts for each currency to keep track of transactions accurately.
  - Alternatively, transactions in less frequently used currencies can be consolidated into domestic A/P, A/R, and bank accounts.
- **Considerations**:
  - The decision should consider the volume of transactions, operational needs, and the level of foreign exchange risk.
  - **Example**: A company dealing extensively with EUR and USD may keep separate accounts for clarity and risk management, while sporadic transactions in JPY may be consolidated into a domestic account.
