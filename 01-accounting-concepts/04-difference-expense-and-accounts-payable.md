## Part 4: Distinguishing Expenses from Accounts Payable (A/P)

### Understanding the Difference
- **Expenses**:
  - **Definition**: Expenses represent the outflow of assets or incurring of liabilities from operational activities.
  - **Recognition**: They are recognized when a cost is incurred, irrespective of when the payment is made.
  - **Example**: Your company pays $1,000 for rent. This amount is recorded as an expense at the time the space is used, regardless of when the payment is actually made.

- **Accounts Payable (A/P)**:
  - **Definition**: Accounts Payable represent the amount a company owes to suppliers or vendors for goods or services purchased on credit.
  - **Recognition**: They reflect future payment obligations and are recorded when the invoice is received, not necessarily when the goods or services are paid for.
  - **Example**: Your company receives an invoice for $2,000 for IT services used, with payment due in 30 days. The $2,000 is recorded in Accounts Payable at the time the invoice is received.

### Key Differences
- The main difference is the timing and reason for the recognition. Expenses relate to the cost of operations and are recognized when incurred, while A/P represents obligations to pay for purchases made on credit and are recognized when billed.
