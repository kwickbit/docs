## Part 3: Understanding the Credit/Debit Accounting Paradigm

### Basics of the Credit/Debit System
In accounting, the credit/debit system is the foundation of double-entry bookkeeping. Every financial transaction involves at least two accounts: one account is debited, and another is credited. This system ensures that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains in balance after each transaction.

### Rules and Principles
- **Debit (Dr.)**: Represents an increase in assets or expenses or a decrease in liabilities, equity, or income.
- **Credit (Cr.)**: Represents a decrease in assets or expenses or an increase in liabilities, equity, or income.
- **Balancing Act**: The total amount debited and the total amount credited in each transaction must always be equal, ensuring that the accounting equation is maintained.

### Example
When a business purchases supplies worth $300 on credit, the transaction involves two accounts:
- Supplies Expense Account (Asset or Expense): Debited $300
- Accounts Payable Account (Liability): Credited $300

This transaction shows an increase in expenses (more supplies) and an increase in liabilities (amount owed), keeping the accounting equation balanced.
