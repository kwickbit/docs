## Part 6: Recording Transactions

### Importance of Accurate Transaction Recording
- Transactions must be accurately recorded in their respective accounts to ensure the financial statements reflect the true financial position and performance of the business.
- **Example**:
    - When a sale of $1,000 is made on credit, it's recorded as an increase in Accounts Receivable and an increase in Sales Revenue, accurately reflecting the business's receivables and revenue.
